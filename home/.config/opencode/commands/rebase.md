description: Fetch origin and rebase current branch onto the default branch
---

The default branch is: $1

Perform the following steps:

1. Fetch the latest changes from origin
2. Rebase the current branch onto the default branch from origin
3. If there are conflicts, resolve them intelligently. Ask me questions if anything is unclear.
